Note that the volatility and return values changes depending on the starting date you choose.

The plots regression line recomends to sell stocks below the regression line and buy when above the regression line. 
Remember to consider other factors aswell, an example could be Alibaba. Here it is recomended to sell, but Alibaba are investing and expanding, so in the short term it is probably good to sell but it could be good in the long term.
